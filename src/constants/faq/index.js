    description:
      "Sephora prioritises the health and wellbeing of our customers and our staff. Customers are required to check in via the Safe Entry QR code placed at the entrance of our stores. They are also required to keep their mask on at all times. Customers must be fully vaccinated in order to enjoy the Mask-Off Services. Store personnel will need to validate customers’ identity and vaccination status before performing the service on the day of the appointment. Sephora reserves the right to deny service if a customer is unable to provide proof of full vaccination* status. For Mask-On Services, customers will be required to keep their masks on for the entire duration of the session. Safe Management measures in-store will be reinforced in line with COVID-19 Preventive Measures. *fully vaccinated = 2 weeks after final dose of vaccine is completed, as confirmed by a valid “vaccinated” status on the customer’s TraceTogether app.",
